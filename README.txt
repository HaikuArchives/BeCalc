BeCalc is a full-featured calculator application for Haiku Created by Computer Inspirations. These sources are provided as a place holder while the BeOS source code is ported to Haiku. So check back in a few weeks for the ported X86 executable.


Description:  Desktop scientific calculator with many features.
	
Notes: BeCalc is an expression-evaluating calculator with a
graphical interface. Equations are entered using either mouse clicks on the
buttons or are typed in directly from either the keyboard or numeric keypad.
Non-volatile history lists store equations and results which are accessible with
a click of the mouse. Arbitrary, named variables, used in calculations, reside
in a third scrollable list. The output numbers use standard floating point
notation, fixed point, scientific or engineering notation. Furthermore,
calculations support imaginary numbers for most functions and are accurate to
more than 200 digits. Logical functions work with binary, octal, decimal,
hexadecimal and other based numbers with accuracies of more than 670 bits.
BeCalc also plots two-dimensional graphs of entered equations, creates mortgage
tables, analyzes statistical trends, and converts between metric, English, and
US units.  More details are available at our web site:
